# Welcome to the `Platypus` project

This is the repo for our group project trying to recreate some of the analyses from Branco et al. 2016 ("**Continental-level population differentiation and environmental adaptation in the mushroom _Suillus brevipes_**") for the Winter 2018 Ecological Genomics (ECL243) class, taught by Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra and Andrew Whitehead. The original manuscript can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13892/full).
